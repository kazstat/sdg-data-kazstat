It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","indicator_available":"Unemployment rate by sex, age","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02","layout":"indicator","national_geographical_coverage":"Kazakhstan","permalink":"/8-5-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"8","source_active_1":true,"source_compilation_1":"Committee on Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan","source_data_1":"Sample Employment Survey","source_implementation_1":"Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population of the Republic of Kazakhstan","tags":[],"target_name":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","target_id":"8.5","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-12-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/kazstat/sdg-data-kazstat/commit/c3e8d258cf58013b62d1143c90f7d04ddafb0c32","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-12-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/kazstat/sdg-data-kazstat/commit/c3e8d258cf58013b62d1143c90f7d04ddafb0c32","is_global_indicator":true,"indicator":"8.5.2"}
