indicator_definition: The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development
  Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation
  and capacity development support” in financial terms. It is essential to be able
  to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government budget
  to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments
  while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries
  over time.
