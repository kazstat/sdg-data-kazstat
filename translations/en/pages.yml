  This national platform for reporting on the UN sustainable development Goals until 2030 (NPR) was developed by the Statistics Committee of the Ministry of national economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan within the framework of the joint economic research Program between the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the World Bank.

  The goal of the NPR is to provide Kazakhstan with data on both global indicators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs) and national indicators.

  The NPR allows international organizations (custodian agencies) responsible for individual indicators to directly upload data for Kazakhstan for their SDG indicators and use them in global reporting.

  In addition, it provides the public concerned with constantly updated information on the status of Kazakhstan's SDG indicators and detailed information on their calculation methodology.

  The SDG indicators published by this NPR are based on both official statistics and data from other administrative sources. Time series have been available at the national level since 2010 for more global and national indicators.

  The SDG indicators published by this NPR are based on both official statistics and data from other administrative sources. Time series have been available at the national level since 2010 for more global and national indicators.

  In the process of nationalization of the SDGs, indicators were divided into several categories: global, global with minor changes, alternative and national.

  *Global indicators* are fully consistent with internationally agreed definitions, and in some cases there are data with minor methodological differences from internationally agreed definitions – *global with minor changes*. However, in other cases, only time series of data with significant deviations from the globally defined calculation methodology are available, so-called *alternative (proxy) indicators*. And in addition to global indicators, *national indicators* have been proposed for some of the SDG targets to better reflect progress towards the SDGs.

  Accordingly, the time series found in the global SDG database for Kazakhstan may differ from the data provided here. The degree of compliance of published data with the global calculation methodology is described in the section" Comparability with UN metadata " under each indicator.

  Please note that this NPR is currently in alpha version, and is therefore still under development.

  The Enterprise open data center (CODE) can also provide guidance and support as part of its national SDG reporting initiative.

  What does the reporting status mean?
  We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:
  * Black: current indicator, data for this indicator is available on this website.
  * White: the indicator is deferred, there is no calculation methodology or initial values.
  * Black and white: the indicator is not relevant for Kazakhstan.

  What does disaggregation mean?
  Disaggregation is used to assess an indicator in more detail by dividing it into subcategories. The most common ones are age or gender. Every indicator has its own specific set of disaggregation categories which are provided either in the indicator’s name or by the international organization responsible for the indicator.

  Is there a methodology of calculation of indicators of the sdgs?
  Yes, the methodology for calculating the global SDG indicators is available on the website stat.gov.kz.
  The methodology for calculating national indicators is currently being developed.

  What results of work in the field of SDG monitoring are available at the moment?
  The results of the work are reflected in the Roadmap of Kazakhstan for monitoring the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2020-2022 (posted on the website stat.gov.kz).

  How often will new data be added to this site?
  Data will be added as they are produced in accordance with the Statistical Work Plan and received from government agencies.

  What are you doing to fill in the gaps in the data?
  In order to generate SDG indicators (including missing data) The Bureau of National Statistics cooperates with interested government agencies and international experts from various custodian agencies.
