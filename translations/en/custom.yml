  <p class="lead-copy">The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> are a universal call to action to
  end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of
  everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015,
  as part of the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&Lang=E">
  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.</p>

  <p class="lead-copy">To monitor and review the implementation of the 17 sustainable development
  goals (SDGs) and 169 targets of the new agenda, a system of global indicators
  developed by the inter-Agency and expert group on indicators of achievement
  of the sustainable development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) is used.</p>

  <p class="lead-copy">Each UN member state can develop national indicators in addition to global
  indicators to help monitor progress in achieving the goals and targets of
  the SDGs at the national level.</p>

  <p class="lead-copy">Kazakhstan has nationalized the global SDG indicators and today the
  monitoring system includes 280 indicators, including 205 global and 75
  national indicators. All available data for each SDG is presented below.</p>
